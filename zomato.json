I got to see why they are such a famous place - there's really nothing you can blame here. They seem to have it figured out",

Many people know this genre of food as soul food, meat and three, southern, or even comfort food. As a native of Nashville, I have been coming to Loveless since before I was born. For a while all the hype was true, Loveless was the best place to go if you want real southern food. However, more than just management changed years ago, and it hasn't been able to restore the former quality that everyone from this town remembers. Now Loveless is busier than they ever have been and the food isn't even half as good.   Now, this next piece of information isn't something to go spreading around to everyone you know visiting or living in Nashville. The reason this place is special is because there aren't herds of people being bussed in to wait 45 minutes in line for cheese grits slathered in a stack of Kraft American singles to the point you feel like you're drinking processed cheese whiz with a sprinkle of grits. You won't feel like you are inside a chain restaurant owned by Opryland. There isn't anyone trying to sell you merchandise while you are cooped up in the waiting area trying to decide whether or not you want to wait any longer for this food.   Where you want to go instead of Loveless is a magical place on Old Hillsboro road right outside of the Nashville city limits that goes by the name Barbara's Home Cooking. If you have been to Loveless and you first arrive at Barbaras, you will be wondering where the line is? Well, I have literally never seen a line there and they have open seating. Once you walk into this home turned restaurant, the lovely women who run the place will greet you with authentic South African accents and the warmest, densest, fluffiest, roll that has ever melted in your mouth. The menu is written on a chalkboard on the wall and almost never changes. The benefit to not having tons of options is that they are able to make everything as fresh as possible.",

I went with my family, so we did the family style meal. For our meats, we got fried chicken and pulled pork. Both were great, but the fried chicken was probably the best I've ever had. It's done right. I wouldn't go there for the pulled pork, but it was still better than I expected. For our sides, we got macaroni and cheese, mashed potatoes and gravy, and hash brown casserole. The macaroni and mashed potatoes were superb. However, I didn't find myself drawn to the hashbrown casserole as much. It was great, but not the best I've had.  Overall, I'd give Loveless an A+. The staff is friendly and warm. There's always a long wait, but there's a reason for that- Everyone wants to eat there. It's one of the best food experiences I've had around the Franklin area. 10/10 recommend.",

We stopped in at 2pm in the afternoon and the line was out the door and down the sidewalk. For the size of the line, they got us in pretty quick. It was a tight squeeze in the restaurant. It’s small and was packed but it was worth it. The staff was very friendly and helpful.  We got a half chicken, medium heat, and a kids meal with mild heat. Sides were mac & cheese, coleslaw, and fries.  The chicken was hot, fresh and delicious. White meat in general can be kind of dry sometimes but theirs was not. The medium heat was spicy enough that hubs was happy (he likes things hot) but not so spicy I couldn’t eat it. They brought us ranch dressing to go with our chicken. I was a little sad to see it come out pre packaged. We probably wouldn’t have used much of it anyway except maybe on those awesome fries. The chicken was awesome by itself.  The mac & cheese was nice and creamy, and the pimento wasn’t over powering but you could appreciate it. The fries we awesome. Crispy, with a great seasoning. And the coleslaw was fresh, not soggy. Hubs and I like our slaw sweet but this wasn’t. It was good for regular slaw. The kiddo loved the coleslaw.  It was a winner all the way around. We will definitely make this a go to stop on our travels out east.",

I don't love all my food super spicy all the time but I like my chicken hot so I went with a small dark meat leg quarter, \"hot\" level. I thought it was perfect. Mac and cheese was decent but the collard greens were meh, although I'm from the midwest so I've only ever been impressed by southern greens once. Overall I have to recommend the chicken but the sides got a mediocre score.",

It was packed so we ended up sitting with a stranger which we had a choice. We didn’t mind. We were starving after running the Nashville half marathon. But we didn’t wait long and we are definitely going back as I plan to take my parents as well.",

The corn and jalapeño are chunky and dense but still tasty. Many options to try, something for everyone - not far (close drive) from the 'I love Nashville' mural, Reese Witherspoon's Draper James boutique, and the Parthenon (yes, Nashville you are the Athens of the South ;) ) worth a visit for a great southern pancake breakfast. Care, queues exist often we've been told.",

The service was advertised and very nice and professional.  As for the food, the pancakes were light, fluffy and good, but I have had better at many other places.  The sausage was not good at all and the eggs/toast were average.  The coffee was good and the atmosphere was nice.  They had a nice gift area, but as everything else in Nashville, it was overpriced.  If I could do it again, I would not.",

We arrived about 10:45 parked in back and got right in. At Fido you go to the counter to order and they bring out your food. My husband got the chorizo and eggs breakfast($10) which came with tortillas and hash browns as well as sour cream and salsa. I chose the steak and eggs scramble without the onion. My breakfast was $11 and came with hash browns and a piece of toast. We also got a chocolate biscotti and an orange cranberry scone. I waited on our drinks while my husband found us a table. We tried the biscotti while we waited on our meals. The biscotti was excellent and is made in house. Our breakfasts came out surprisingly quick, Both were very good. My eggs had fresh spinach and Gouda cheese and the hash brown were hand cut. Fido is eco friendly and uses paper straws. We were full so we took the scone to go.",

Not realizing that there was a free New Year’s Eve concert in downtownNashville, we headed down to Broadway to grab some lunch.  That explained the cordoned off streets and exorbitant parking (at noon).  We found a paid lot next to the Ryman and walked down to Broadway in the drizzle.  We turned the corner past Tootsie’s and as soon as we passed Robert’s Western World, we found ourselves standing at the end of the line waiting to go into Jack’s Bar-B-Que.  Originally opening in 1989 at the corner of Broadway and First Avenue, Jack lost his lease to development by the riverfront (to a spot that became the Hard Rock Cafe) and moved up Broadway to the current location – they’ve since opened two additional locations in town.A line stretching out the door at 1:30 on a Saturday is usually a sign of one of two things – either there is excellent food or they are the only game in town.  I could see other restaurants across the street, so we were hoping for the former.  The good thing about the line is that we weren’t waiting for a table – we were actually in the line for counter service, where you order.   It was  fifty to sixty people deep, but we moved through it and up to the steam table and register in about twenty minutes.  Actually, instead of “we”, I moved up there while my beloved snagged a table for two, by the window.  Actually, it was a table pushed up against the window with half a booth for seating.  It made for cozy dining.",

Going downtown Nashville one would expect live music and cheery entertainers. BBQ had decent flavor with little smoke. I had the smoked sausage and it had a good snap to it but not entirely too much smoke. Their mac and cheese was good though. I tried their sweet and smoky sauce which was nice.",

What's not to love about fried chicken, corn pudding and sweet potatoes drowned in brown sugar?A big part of soul food is \"Meat and three.\" Meat and three, which has roots in Nashville, is essentially a plate that consists of a main meat (fried chicken, meatloaf, pork chop, country ham), and three side dishes (vegetables, potatoes, macaroni and cheese).Arnold's Country Kitchen is the iconic meat-and-three restaurant. Once we parked in the Arnold's lot, we walked inside restaurant and were met with the large, open dining space. Long communal tables ran the length of the room, with few open seats spaced out in between. We added ourselves to the back of the line and waited as people filed up to the cafeteria-style counter.The menu changes a little bit by the day. And, fortunately, we were there on a meat loaf day (yum!). You can get a main and just one or two sides, but what fun is that? I wanted the full meat and three experience. So, I got the meat loaf, candied yams, macaroni and cheese, and corn pudding. I probably should've thrown something green in there, but ehhh...We just so happened to find an empty booth along the wall, so we hunkered down there before we began devouring these plates. My god, I wish this blog had tastebuds, because that meat loaf killed the game. So flavorful. So moist. So hella good. The macaroni and cheese was a delicious baked mac with some nice dark spots along the top. Sweet candied yams bathed in brown sugar were sweet as a dessert, and the corn pudding had more of a spice factor, but it was perfect for this plate of food.Just, go. Immediately. Go hungry and eat all these things. You're welcome.Grade: A",

My only wish is that they had a good cookies and cream. If they did I overlooked it. Love the atmosphere and we happened to go on a beautiful day in Nashville. So it was packed and folks were eating both inside and outside. My son wore that scoop of ice cream out. So I’m sure he would give it a two thumbs up",

And Nashville has no shortage of them.Marche Artisan Foods is one of those places. This European-style cafe and marketplace is located in the heart of historic East Nashville, and seemed like this perfect brunch option.The restaurant itself is very sweet with split-level dining paired up with a small marketplace. I loved the windows lining the walls of the space and the brick and exposed duct work. Just very cool.The menu for breakfast had a number of croissants, crepes, french toast, scrambled eggs and omelettes. I, however, went for a simple cheese plate which had goat cheese, peach jam and Pugliese toast. This was simple, but this was probably my favorite goat cheese I've ever had. It had just a bit of bite, but it wasn't overpowering. The jam was great, and the toast was nice and light. The perfect light option that I was just in the mood for, with the perfect ambiance and great service.Grade: A",

At lunch they would break and cook traditional Thai dishes for the staff. One day a customer came to pick up his car during lunch and Sam offered him lunch. This customer was so impressed with his lunch he told Sam he should be fixing lunch and dinner instead of cars.  So Sam remodeled the house above the garage and The Smiling Elephant was born and those of us who live in Nashville are very happy for the change in career.",

The only thing that wasn't to my liking was the papaya salad, which was too salty. I'll be back next time I'm in town.",

There was plenty of pepper sauce at the table to adjust heat levels but this was one time I actually enjoyed the flavor as it was served. Very intense and deep flavors in all three items I ordered.",

The beef taco was pretty good, but not as spectacular. The ingredients are obviously very fresh and the guys running the place clearly know their way around a taco. The atmosphere is fun if you're into hole-in-the-wall places, which I am. It's nothing fancy but the tacos were worth the trip from Franklin. I'd come again. Make sure you have cash to pay because they don't accept credit cards. I learned this the hard way and had to wait in line twice. Still worth it.",

Flavors were on point. There was bacon in it which automatically made it enjoyable. Nice texture from the snap peas. Relatively good price considering the quality of food and atmosphere. My girlfriend and I ate for $60. Make sure to book a reservation or you'll end up waiting an hour and a half like me. I wouldn't really recommend outdoor dining. The tables for 2 are pretty small and cluttered. I was kinda scared I was gonna knock something over. Overall this was a stellar experience and I definitely plan on returning (with reservations this time).",

Portions are massive. My one minuscule complaint is that the restroom is down a pretty steep set of stairs. At almost 8 months pregnant it was quite inconvenient. I can only imagine what it would be like after sharing a bottle of wine.",

No apps this trip as we had one prior to dining. Chopped salad was good, Gnocchi dish was rich and flavorful and my Di Mare with penne was a seafood extravaganza.   A lot of food and we also had hot bread with olive oil.  Packed some to go and would be back on another trip.  Valet parking is $3.",
